## Preparing Yourself For A European Journey
This continent is full of history, culture, and amazing sights that are worth visiting. From locations like Paris or een Rome, each part has something unique to offer. My guide will help you plan your tour of europe accordingly, highlighting places that I too plan to visit in this coming July and even give traveling tips!

## Section 2
Planning a tour of Europe requires alot of planning and attention to detail. Start by figuring out what interests you the most—whether it’s historical locations, sight seeing worthy views/buildings, food, or etc. Europe’s transportation system, including trains, buses, and affordable air fares which makes it easy to travel between the different countries.
### Step 1
I would say to start of a list of places that you hands down would love to visit initially then work and build within this list. Research as much as you can to gain deeper understanding of the geography and distances between places. 
### Step 2
Book your international flight first, *then* buy and plan for your domestic ones later (but still ahead of time, never last minute!)
### Step 3
Plan and book those domestic flights, then decide and configure what activities and resturaunts it is that you would like to visit whether they may be family friendly, or for a night out with new friends. 
## My Personal Must Visit Locations
Following those steps above, I have now successfully planed my roommate and I's trip to Europe this upcoming July! We will be flying into **London** spending time there, then take the train to **Paris**. In Europe train travel is very flexible and could be could potentially be the best option for travel logistics for you as well! After **Paris**, we fly into **Barcelona**, and then fly to **Rome** as well. After taking a few days to train to and visit **Florence**, we will fly to **Greece** then back up to the **Netherlands** where we will spend time with family and complete our tour!
