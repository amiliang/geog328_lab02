        For step 1 of beginning to plan your European trip, I would say to start of a list of places that you hands down would love to visit. Then later work and build within this list. Researching as much as you can is advised in order to gain deeper understanding of the geography and distances between places, as well as for safety purposes.

    Maybe begin with places youve seen online that you may want to take a trip to, places you know that you may have friends or family you would be interested in visiting, or even locations or sites you've learned about in school!
