        For step 2 of beginning to plan your European trip, book your international flight! Doing this first then later buying and planning for your domestic flights later this would help you secure your ticket and better prices way more ahead of time and get you sealed to the deal of this trip! Setting those start and end dates in stone also allow you to guage and gaine a better understanding of how  much time you will have to move and travel between the places. Make sure to not take too long to get those domestic flights though because they will increase as time goes on!
