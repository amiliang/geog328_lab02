    Following those steps listed throughout these pages, I have now successfully planed my roommate and I's trip to Europe this upcoming July! We will be flying into **London** spending time there, then take the train to **Paris**. In Europe train travel is very flexible and could be could potentially be the best option for travel logistics for you as well! After **Paris**, we fly into **Barcelona**, and then fly to **Rome** as well. After taking a few days to train to and visit **Florence**, we will fly to **Greece** then back up to the **Netherlands** where we will spend time with family and complete our tour!
